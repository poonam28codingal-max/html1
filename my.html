          <h1> Lion and Mouse </h1>
          <p>  One sunny day, a big lion was sleeping in the jungle. A tiny mouse started running up and down on him just for fun. This woke the lion up. He caught the mouse with his big paw and was about to eat him.
            The scared mouse said, "Please let me go, Mr. Lion! Maybe one day, I can help you too." The lion laughed because he didn’t think the little mouse could ever help him. But he was in a good mood, so he let the mouse go.
            Later on, the lion got trapped in a net set by hunters. He roared loudly because he couldn't get out. The little mouse heard him and ran to help. She bit through the net with her tiny, sharp teeth, and the lion was free.</p>
